I am using google Colab with HF_TOKEN secret key.

I have a file sft_marcus.jsonl

`{"prompt": "What is your philosophy on leadership?", "response": "Leadership means serving first, guiding with clarity, and empowering others."}
{"prompt": "How do you usually start your day?", "response": "I begin with reflection and a quick review of priorities before diving into focused work."}
{"prompt": "What motivates you most?", "response": "Seeing people and teams grow stronger through challenges motivates me the most."}`

I want to fine tune with `model_name = "meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf`

Write an ipynb sytle VScode python script to do this and save model to iwswordpress/marcus
Keep as simple as possible
